//for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {[loopBody];}
// initialition = expression or variable declaration; used to initialize a counter variable; may optionally declare new variables with the var keyword 
//condition: expression evaluate before each loop iteration; if expression evaluates to true, statement is executed
//iteration: statement exectured at the end of each iteration; typically involves incrementing or decrementing a counter, bringing loop closer to end 
//loopBody: code that runs on every iteration as long as condition evalurates to true 
//USE THIS LOOP WHEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YIMES YOU WANT THE LOOP TO RUN- FOR EX, WHEN YOU HAVE AN ARRAY OF KNOWN SIZE

//should console log when receiving 0 as a paramenter because the do-while runs before the condition is checked
